Ezyshop big data architecture 
Real-time analytics plays a critical role in enabling EzyShop to remain competitive and responsive in the rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape. By capturing and analyzing data as it is generated—such as customer clicks, searches, and purchase transactions—EzyShop can deliver highly personalized experiences, which have been shown to significantly increase customer engagement and loyalty (Chen, Chiang, & Storey, 2012). This real-time insight facilitates dynamic pricing strategies, tailored marketing campaigns, and instant product recommendations that meet individual customer preferences. Moreover, the ability to process data instantly allows EzyShop to react to emerging trends and behavioral patterns promptly, which is essential in a market where customer preferences and competitive conditions can shift rapidly (LaValle et al., 2011).

In addition to improving customer experiences, real-time analytics supports operational excellence within EzyShop’s supply chain and inventory management processes. Accurate, timely data on product demand enables the company to optimize stock levels, reducing the risks of overstocking or stockouts, thereby maximizing profitability and customer satisfaction (Davenport, 2014). Real-time monitoring of sales and inventory also allows for agile decision-making that aligns supply with current market conditions. The literature confirms that firms leveraging real-time big data analytics are better equipped to develop dynamic capabilities that enhance overall firm performance and adaptability (Fosso Wamba et al., 2020). For EzyShop, integrating real-time analytics into their business operations is thus indispensable for sustaining growth, enhancing customer retention, and ensuring efficient allocation of resources.
